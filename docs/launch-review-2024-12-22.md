## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks (Must Fix Before Production)

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Unpatched dependencies | High | Unknown | Run pnpm audit, update vulnerable packages |
| Missing security headers | High | Certain | Add @fastify/helmet middleware |
| No alerting configured | High | Certain | Set up PagerDuty + Prometheus |
| No TLS/SSL | High | Certain | Configure certificates |

**All critical risks have clear mitigations identified.**

---

### High Risks (Should Fix Before Production)

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| No regression testing | Medium | Medium | Execute regression checklist on staging |
| No retention policy | Medium | High | Define 90-day retention, implement cleanup |
| PII redaction not integrated | Medium | Medium | Verify redaction in all integration points |
| No end-to-end validation | Medium | Medium | Complete orchestration flow testing |

**All high risks can be addressed in Phase 2 (Staging).**

---

### Medium Risks (Monitor)

- Rate limiting not implemented (can add post-launch)
- Session timeout not enforced (can add post-launch)
- MFA not available (can add post-launch)
- No circuit breaker pattern (can add post-launch)

---

### Low Risks (Acceptable)

- n8n workflows not deployed (local execution works)
- Environment not validated on physical hardware (can use cloud/VM)
- No anomaly detection (nice-to-have)

## Launch Recommendation

### ✅ Approved for: Staging Deployment

The Mother-Harness platform is **ready for staging deployment** with the following:
- Strong security foundation
- Comprehensive monitoring and incident response
- Excellent documentation
- Good test coverage

### ⚠️ Not Approved for: Production Deployment

**Reasons:**
1. Security dependencies not audited
2. Security headers not implemented
3. Alerting system not configured
4. TLS/SSL not configured
5. No regression testing on staging
6. No user acceptance testing
7. Retention policy not defined

### Timeline to Production

**Best Case:** 21 days (3 weeks)
- Week 1: Fix critical security issues, deploy to staging
- Week 2: Beta testing and hardening
- Week 3: Production deployment prep and launch

**Realistic:** 30 days (4 weeks)
- Accounts for unexpected issues in beta
- Buffer for security findings
- Time for user feedback incorporation

- ⚠️ Critical security tasks remain (dependency audit, headers, TLS)
- ⚠️ Staging validation needed
- ⚠️ Beta testing required

**Recommendation:**
1. **Proceed to staging** immediately
2. **Complete Phase 1 & 2** (critical security + staging validation)
3. **Run beta program** (Phase 3)
4. **Launch to production** in 3-4 weeks

The platform is well-architected and the remaining work is primarily operational readiness and validation. With focused execution on the critical path, production launch is achievable within the next month.
